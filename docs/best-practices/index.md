# Best Practices & Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive best practices and guidelines for successful project delivery and team collaboration across all phases of the software development lifecycle.

## Requirements Gathering Best Practices

This document aims to provide the best practices in the requirements gathering phase of the Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and Stakeholder responsibilities to emphasize iterative development and collaboration practices followed at Accion Labs.

### Roles & Responsibilities

The below table provides actionable responsibilities for each stakeholder during backlog refinement, paired with real-world examples and references to ensure clarity and alignment with industry standards.

**Product Owner (PO)**

- Collaborate with Stakeholders, Customers, and end-users to gather functional and non-functional requirements in the form of wireframes, documents and PDFs.
- Create and maintain a prioritized product backlog that captures all identified requirements and ensures it remains up-to-date and reflects changing business priorities or Stakeholder inputs.
- Discuss with Stakeholders (internal/ external) to understand & prioritize product increments based on agreed expectations from the product.
- Facilitate brainstorming sessions, interviews, or workshops to identify pain points, desired features, and system constraints.
- Create Epics and User Stories, break down high-level business objectives into epics, User stories, and detailed acceptance criteria. Example: "As a user, I want to reset my password so that I can regain access to my account."
- Collaborate with System Architects to understand technical feasibility and constraints, validate and refine requirements with the Business Analyst.
- Set realistic expectations about deliverables, timelines, and scope limitations. Set priority for User Stories by soliciting information from the Scrum Team and the Architecture experts to ensure technical feasibility.
- Address blockers or dependencies by coordinating with Architects or external teams. Example: Finalizing API contracts for a dependent feature.

**Business Analyst (BA)**

- Work with Stakeholders and Product Owners to gather requirements translating them into backlog items as Epics, User stories, or Tasks.
- Review Customer requirements Wireframes / Documents/PDFs.
- Detailed functional requirements using industry-standard templates (e.g., BRD, FRD). Example: Include wireframes for a feature request involving a complex user interface.
- Conduct User interviews / Surveys and present results to the team. Example: A survey reveals the need for multi-language support for the application.
- Validate and refine user stories to ensure alignment with business goals. Example: Confirm that the "export report" functionality meets client compliance standards.

**Project Manager (PM)**

- Review wireframes, clickable mockups and identify issues with requirements. Track the team's progress in gathering and documenting requirements to ensure alignment with the project schedule.
- Define activities, timelines, and allocate resources, assign team members, including Business Analysts to the phase.
- Organize and lead meetings between Stakeholders, Business Analysts, and technical teams to gather requirements.
- Identify and document expected outputs of the requirements phase, such as finalized requirement documents, user stories, or use cases.
- Define, and track milestones for completion of key deliverables, Organize and facilitate backlog refinement sessions weekly. Example: Use a 1-hour session to refine 10 top-priority stories.
- Document dependencies and escalate risks to Stakeholders. Example: Flag a delay in API delivery affecting the current sprint.
- Align Backlog scope with Sprint Capacity. Example: Ensure the team commits to a feasible number of stories during Sprint Planning.

**Architect**

- Review and evaluate the requirements gathered by the Product Owner or Business Analyst to ensure technical feasibility.
