## Extended Delivery Center (EDC) Model

Our Extended Delivery Center is based on Accion's core value propositions of co-development, virtual teams, and a 100% white-box approach. In an EDC engagement model, Accion owns the entire responsibility of delivery. This is based on Accion's strong operational and governance models with a focus on value creation.

### Key Components

- [100% White-box Model - Approach](customer-deal-signoff.md#100-white-box-model---approach)
- [EDC Models and Options](customer-deal-signoff.md#edc-models)
- [Typical EDC Delivery Organization](customer-deal-signoff.md#typical-edc-delivery-organization)
- [Customer Collaboration Models](customer-deal-signoff.md#customer-collaboration-models)
- [EDC Phases](customer-deal-signoff.md#edc-phases)

The delivery practices & processes are defined and streamlined between the teams onsite and offshore. The team defines the process, governance, and tools that will be used to plan, prioritize and execute defined projects & programs.

### Our EDC is powered by:

- Accion's participation in the product roadmap, tools, and the selection of technology
- The whole team that participates in account growth, the creation of value, and innovation
- Influencing process best practices, checklists, templates, etc.
- An Engagement Manager who works closely with delivery, builds customer relationships, Handles escalations and new SOWs
- The team who can recommend sourcing and skill needs that provide maximum ROI
- A delivery team that runs projects also drives growth through delivery-driven sales
- An autonomous engineering team that can co-learn, measure performance, boost productivity and identify risks & pre-empt issues early.
